              Friendly Totes is an e-commerce website focused on selling sturdy,
              collapsible totes that not only help the environment, but also
              support the special needs community. When someone purchases a
              Friendly Tote, they are not only being friendly to the
              environment, but also the special needs community all around the

            <h3>PROCESS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                <a href="#phase1">Phase 1. Research and Testing</a>

            <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Shopping totes are normally flimsy and can't carry a lot of
                items. Friendly Totes wanted their shopping bags to be sturdy
                and collapsible while also providing a way for the customer to
                carry numerous items with ease.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Most shopping totes only help the environment because the
                customers are using reusable bags instead of plastic bags.
                Friendly Totes wanted to make sure they were also supporting the
                environment by using 100% sustainable materials when they made
                the bags.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. There are a lot of shopping totes that one can purchase at
                the grocery store but Friendly Totes stands out because it is
                founded by a family who is passionate about supporting the
                special needs community.
              </li>
              <li></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Use images throughout the website that show how the bags are
                strong, sturdy, and can expand to carry numerous items.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. The best way for someone to know that the totes are helping
                the environement is by seeing it right when they open the page.
                By adding the rotating bar that says "Friendly to: The Special
                Needs Community and The Environment", the user automatically
                knows the totes support the environment. There is also
                information about how the bags are made from sustainable
                materials on the "Our Story" section of the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Make it clear on the website that Friendly Totes supports the
                special needs community by displaying it in the rotating bar on
                the homepage, using images of the family members that founded
                the company, Friendly Totes, and have an about section that
                gives the vision behind the company and why this family is
                passionate about supporting the special needs community.

                    The goal with Friendly Totes was to make a shopping tote
                    site that differentiated itself from its competitors. I
                    performed an in-depth competitive analysis of the most
                    popular tote sites which included, BagPodz, Baggu, and
                    Colony Co. Reusable Grocery Bag.

                    <li>
                      1. BagPodz Strengths: comes with 10 bags and a storage
                      pouch, water-resistant, machine washable, clip that
                      attaches to a shopping car, 4.8-star Amazon customer
                      rating based on 605 reviews, durable - strong ripstop
                      nylon, and high weight capacity.

                    <li>
                      2. Baggu Strengths: reusable shopping bag that could
                      double as a regular bag, interior zipper pocket, two sets
                      of straps — top handles and shoulder straps, machine

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      1. BagPodz Weaknesses: Lacking in diverse design patterns,
                      some have said they wish the bags were bigger, and does
                      not stand on its own
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      2. Baggu Weaknesses: The size makes it better for smaller
                      runs and not good for a big shopping trip. It needs to be
                      hung to dry so it doesn’t fade. There's a lack of interior
                      padding making it difficult to carry fragile items like
                      eggs, bread, or glass. They are expensive, do not stand on
                      their own and no organization or padding.

            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              I performed three usability tests on the design.

              Corrections that needed to be made included:

            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Making the images for the totes clickable so a customer could
                click on the image to get a close look at the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Creating a "sign in as a guest" option for the checkout process
                so customers didn't feel obligated to sign up for an account to
                purchase something.

              <li>
                3. Fixing typos throughout the site.  
              </li>
              <li>
                I made the changes in mockups to reflect the feedback given.

            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              High Fidelity Mockup User Testing Feedback:
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              I completed three usability tests and the notes were very
              insightful.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The five tasks were: (1) Sign Up, (2) Login, (3) Create New
              Document, (4) Upload Image, (5) Share a File.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">User Feedback:</p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The first user was able to click through each task with ease and
              mentioned that that it was clear.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The second user got stumped on a few things and gave feedback on
              five separate areas of the design. The main issues she kept
              running into were unrecognizable icons. She wanted more clarity on
              what each icon meant.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The third user specifically got stumped on a the “Create New
              Document” task because the button wasn’t clear. The second one the
              user got stumped on was the “Sharing a File” task because the
              share icon didn’t appear to exist to them. I will need to expand
              it and make it more clear.

            <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The project began with three problems that needed to be solved. These problems included: (1) Shopping totes were flimsy and couldn't carry a lot of
              items. (2) Most shopping totes were only helping the environment because the customers were using reusable bags instead of plastic bags. However, Friendly Totes wanted to stand out by using sustainable materials. (3) There were a lot of totes for sale but they didn't support a cause.

            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The solutions to these problems were: (1) Using images throughout the website that showed how the bags were
                strong, sturdy, and expandable. (2) Show customers that the totes were not only helping people use less plastic but that the product was biodegradable and the materials were sustainable. (3) Make it obvious that Friendly totes supports a cause by placing it on the homepage and "Our Story" section.               </li>
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              There were a couple vital takeaways from the project, which included:

              <li>
                <strong>
                 (1) Customers want a product that helps improve their lives and usually focus on finding a great product first. Then, looking to see if it supports a cause or helps the environment. (2) E-commerce sites need to be extremely clickable. Customers want the easiest possible way to be able to glance at something to checkout. Removing extra steps from this process makes the customer happy and wanting to come back for more.
