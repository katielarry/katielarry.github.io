          <h3 style="text-align:center">Why I Love UX/UI Design</h3>
          <p>
            Design allows people to decipher information in a beautiful, easily
            comprehensible way. As they say, “knowledge is power.” So, when we
            give people an opportunity to comprehend information more easily, we
            give them an opportunity to grow and completely change their future.
            That’s what excites me about design!
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, design has the potential to change someone’s
            everyday life for the better. When someone is navigating a real
            estate website and searching for their first home, their experience
            of buying that home could be completely tainted due to a bad user
            experience. However, if they are able to navigate the page with
            ease, they are given the space to dream, cherish that moment, and
            get enthusiastic about the exciting decision they are about to make.
            I want to be a part of making someone’s everyday life better by
            providing great every day experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, design provided me an opportunity to learn about something
            I was passionate about, change careers, and dream again. I would
            love to see people have the same opportunities I’ve had by mentoring
            people as they change careers and help them do something they find
            deeply fulfilling.

          <h3 style="text-align:center">The Path that Led to Design</h3>
          <p>
            I was introduced to design through a college art course and found
            true joy in creating and learning how to use structure along with
            creativity to make something beautiful. I ended up going down a
            different career path, but found myself always being drawn back to
            design and how exciting it was to create, innovate, and problem
            solve through design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though my original career path wasn’t as fulfilling as I
            thought it would be, the time I spent there wasn’t wasted. I learned
            the immense value of receiving feedback, developing as a leader, and
            how to manage numerous projects at once. I believe these three key
            areas of growth have had and will continue to have an invaluable
            impact on me as I continue to learn how to become a better UX/UI
            Designer.
