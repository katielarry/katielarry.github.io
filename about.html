          <p>
            <b
              >Design allows people to decipher information in a beautiful,
              easily comprehensible way.</b
            >As they say, “knowledge is power.” So, when we give people an
            opportunity to comprehend information more easily, we give them an
            opportunity to grow and completely change their future. That’s what
            excites me about design!
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            More specifically, design has the potential to change someone’s
            everyday life for the better. When someone is navigating a real
            estate website and searching for their first home, their experience
            of buying that home could be completely tainted due to a bad user
            experience. However, if they are able to navigate the page with
            ease, they are given the space to dream, cherish that moment, and
            get enthusiastic about the exciting decision they are about to make.
            I want to be a part of making someone’s everyday life better by
            providing great every day experiences.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            <b
              >Design provided me an opportunity to learn about something I was
              passionate about, change careers, and dream again.</b
            >
            I would love to see people have the same opportunities I’ve had by
            mentoring people as they change careers and help them do something
            they find deeply fulfilling.

          <h3 style="text-align:center">The Path that Led to Design</h3>
          <p>
            <b
              >I have always been passionate about finding a career that uses
              empathy and creativity to help people.</b
            >
            A few years ago, my husband was in school to become a developer and
            heard about UX design. He quickly told me about it thinking I would
            really enjoy a career doing something like that. I began to research
            it and decided to jump into an extensive UX Design bootcamp called
            Bloc.io. The more I learned, the more I fell in love with the
            industry. The possibilities to create products that improve people's
            lives and ultimately make the world a better place are endless.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Through my previous work experiences, I learned the value of
              receiving feedback, developing as a leader, and how to manage
              numerous projects at once.</b
            >
            I'm excited to use these three key areas of growth to support my
            teammates and the design industry as I continue to learn how to
            become a better UX/UI Designer.
