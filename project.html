              Cloud storage platforms are in high demand as people need more
              storage to keep their personal and professional lives organized.
              The goal of OnePlace was to create a space where people could
              store their files, organize/create content, and even communicate
              via the application.

            <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>1. Sharing content can be confusing and take too long.</li>
              <li>
                2. Organizing content can be difficult with numerous files.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Many cloud storage applications don’t have content creation
                as an option but users want the options to create projects for
                professional and personal use and save them to their cloud
                storage applications.)
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Uploading Images/videos can either take too long or the
                process isn’t intuitive.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Sharing Content: Make it as intuitive as possible by right
                clicking on files to share.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Organizing content: Use categories to easily organize files,
                folders, and links.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Create Content/Collaborate: Provide a seamless way to create
                content and save in application.
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Uploading large and small files: Make the uploading proess
                quick and easy by using a drag and drop feature and creating the
                platform so that it can withstand uploading large files.

                After performing user research, I found the best way to
                differentiate a new cloud storage platform from the rest was to
                create an application where someone could perform all of their
                productivity needs in one spot. These productivity features
                included: store files, create documents, communicate,
                collaborate, and manage projects.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The target audience was focused on teachers, families, students,
                and those in the workplace. This lead to the name, OnePlace with
                the slogan, “Simplify your life by going to OnePlace for
                everything.” The branding design was inspired by three words:
                minimalist, sohpisticated, and organized.

                2. opted for the color scheme to stay the same (gold) on the

              <li>

            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The first user was able to click through each task with ease and
              mentioned that that it was clear.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The second user got stumped on a few things and gave feedback on
              five separate areas of the design. The main issues she kept
              running into were unrecognizable icons. She wanted more clarity on
              what each icon meant.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The third user specifically got stumped on a the “Create New
              Document” task because the button wasn’t clear. The second one the
              user got stumped on was the “Sharing a File” task because the
              share icon didn’t appear to exist to them. I will need to expand
              it and make it more clear.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              I made the changes in mockups to reflect the feedback given.

            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              Once all the testing and designing was completed, I ended up with
              a product that was clear, intuitive, and straightforward. The
              feedback given by each user was invaluable through the process and
              because of all the insight given, I was able to complete the goal
              I was trying to achieve.
            </p>
            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              The main learning curve I had was making sure each icon was clear
              to the users. I kept using icons without words next to them which
              created confusion for my users when trying to complete different
              tasks. When I added verbiage to the icons, the users were able to
              breeze through the tasks without extra assistance.

            <p class="caseStudy-text">
              My takeaways from this project consisted of two things:
            </p>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Just because something is clear to me, doesn’t mean it’s
                clear to everyone (icon example).
              </li>
              <li>
                2. The product’s design only matters if the user is able to
                easily navigate the page. Otherwise, it’s just a pretty design
                that frustrates users.
