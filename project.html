              Cloud storage platforms are in high demand as people need more
              storage to keep their personal and professional lives organized.
              The goal of OnePlace was to create a space where people could
              store their files, organize/create content, and even communicate
              via the application.

            <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>1. Sharing content can be confusing and take too long.</li>
              <li>
                2. Organizing content can be difficult with numerous files.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Many cloud storage applications don’t have content creation
                as an option but users want the options to create projects for
                professional and personal use and save them to their cloud
                storage applications.)
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Uploading Images/videos can either take too long or the
                process isn’t intuitive.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <ol class="num-list">
              <li>
                1. Sharing Content: Make it as intuitive as possible by right
                clicking on files to share.
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Organizing content: Use categories to easily organize files,
                folders, and links.
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Create Content/Collaborate: Provide a seamless way to create
                content and save in application.
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Uploading large and small files: Make the uploading proess
                quick and easy by using a drag and drop feature and creating the
                platform so that it can withstand uploading large files.

                Most people fall into the third category and just need a little
                help with getting everything in one place easily and
                efficiently. There are cloud storage apps that specialize in
                performing different tasks for their users. My goal was to
                create the most intuitive version of each of those tasks and
                combine them so users could truly use OnePlace for all of their
                productivity needs.

              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                After performing user research, I found the best way to
                differentiate a new cloud storage platform from the rest was to
                create an application where someone could perform all of their
                productivity needs in one spot. These productivity features
                included: store files, create documents, communicate,
                collaborate, and manage projects.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">

              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                This lead to the name, OnePlace with the slogan, “Simplify your

              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The branding design was inspired by three words: minimalist,

              <h3>PREFERENCE TESTING</h3>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                I performed three preference tests on the design. Two were
                focused on using stock images or actual images of the product on
                the website. One was focused on using Google’s branding colors
                on the Sign Up portion of the site.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                After gathering the data, it was clear the users:
              </p>
              <ol class="num-list">
                <li>
                  1. wanted to see images of the actual product on the site
                  rather than stock images.
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. opted for the color scheme to stay the same (gold) on the
                  Sign Up page instead of changing Google’s name to light blue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. recommended I add Google’s logo so it went with branding
                  better.

                High Fidelity Mockup User Testing Feedback:
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                I completed three usability tests and the notes were very
                insightful.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The five tasks were: (1) Sign Up, (2) Login, (3) Create New
                Document, (4) Upload Image, (5) Share a File.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">User Feedback:</p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The first user was able to click through each task with ease and
                mentioned that that it was clear.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The second user got stumped on a few things and gave feedback on
                five separate areas of the design. The main issues she kept
                running into were unrecognizable icons. She wanted more clarity
                on what each icon meant.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The third user specifically got stumped on a the “Create New
                Document” task because the button wasn’t clear. The second one
                the user got stumped on was the “Sharing a File” task because
                the share icon didn’t appear to exist to them. I will need to
                expand it and make it more clear.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                I made the changes in mockups to reflect the feedback given.

              <h3>PHASE 5: CONCLUSION</h3>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                Once all the testing and designing was completed, I ended up
                with a product that was clear, intuitive, and straightforward.
                The feedback given by each user was invaluable through the
                process and because of all the insight given, I was able to
                complete the goal I was trying to achieve.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                The main learning curve I had was making sure each icon was
                clear to the users. I kept using icons without words next to
                them which created confusion for my users when trying to
                complete different tasks. When I added verbiage to the icons,
                the users were able to breeze through the tasks without extra
                assistance.
              </p>
              <p class="caseStudy-text">
                My takeaways from this project consisted of two things: (1) Just
                because something is clear to me, doesn’t mean it’s clear to
                everyone (icon example). (2) The product’s design only matters
                if the user is able to easily navigate the page. Otherwise, it’s
                just a pretty design that frustrates users.
